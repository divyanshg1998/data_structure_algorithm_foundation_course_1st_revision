}Given a graph with adjacency list representation of the edges between the nodes, the task is to implement Dijkstraï¿½s Algorithm for single source shortest path using Priority Queue in Java.

Given a graph and a source vertex in graph, find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph.
